**Full Description:**

Tired of losing track of your research or sifting through endless history lists? Memoria transforms your Chrome browsing history into an intelligent, AI-organized experience.

**Rediscover Your Digital Footprints with AI Journeys:**

Memoria's core feature is "Journeys." Our AI analyzes your browsing patterns, automatically grouping visited pages by topic and task. Whether you're deep into project research, planning your next vacation, or comparing products, Memoria clusters related pages together, making it effortless to pick up where you left off or review your thought process.

**Key Features:**

*   ✨ **AI-Powered Journeys:** Beyond simple chronology, Memoria understands the *context* of your browsing, creating smart, thematic collections.
*   🚀 **Fast & Fluid Interface:** Enjoy a clean, modern, and professional UI that replaces the default history page and loads instantly.
*   🔍 **Efficient Search:** Quickly locate any page within your entire history or inside specific Journeys.
*   📅 **Flexible Views:** Switch between the innovative "Journeys" view and a traditional "All History" list with date filters.
*   🔒 **Privacy Conscious:** Your history data is processed locally. We provide a direct link to Chrome's built-in tools for clearing your browsing data, keeping you in control.

**How it Works:**

Memoria runs locally in your browser. To enable the AI Journey categorization, you'll need to provide your own Google Gemini API key in the extension settings. This ensures your data remains private and leverages the power of cutting-edge AI.

Stop just browsing, start journeying. Install Memoria today and unlock the true potential of your browsing history!
