# Privacy Policy for Memoria

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026

Thank you for using Memoria. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information. Our goal is to provide you with a powerful history tool while respecting your privacy.

## Information We Handle

Memoria works with your local browser history. To provide its core functionality, the extension performs the following actions:

1.  **Reading History:** The extension reads your browser history (URLs and page titles) from the last 90 days using the `chrome.history` API.
2.  **AI Processing:** To create "Journeys", the URLs and titles of your history items are sent to a secure AI model (Google's Gemini model) for analysis. This data is used solely for the purpose of grouping your history into meaningful Journeys and is not stored or logged by the AI model beyond the immediate processing request.
3.  **Local Storage:** The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to save your preference for the onboarding message (whether you have dismissed it or not). It does not store any of your browsing history.

## Information We Do NOT Handle

*   **No Server Storage:** Memoria does **not** store your browsing history on any remote servers. All your history data stays on your computer, with the exception of the temporary, in-memory processing by the AI model.
*   **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location.
*   **No Data Selling:** We will never sell your data to third parties.

## Data Deletion

Memoria does not have its own copy of your history to delete. To delete your browser history, you can use Chrome's built-in "Clear Browsing Data" feature, which Memoria provides a convenient link to.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
